        <p>
          SoCal resident, CS student, and Christian. I enjoy creating and writing to solve problems, whether fabricating prose or programs.

        <h3 class="section-title">How I Started CS</h3><br>
        <p>
          I had gotten curious about computers and software as a high school student. It seemed like magic that time to see games like <em>Minecraft</em> just launch and work! I got curious over time. Thus, I took my first introductory computer science class in high school. As my passion for the subject grew, I became interested in Python first. With it's simpler, cleaner syntax, I could learn how to code and think like a budding programmer at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          After high school, I studied at my local community college. At least two and a half years passed. During that time, I took multiple courses to learn about topics: introduction to programming languages, understanding how algorithms work, and other topics such as advanced Java programming with databases. The major became my passion worth pursuing. To this day, I brainstorm, create, and tinker.
